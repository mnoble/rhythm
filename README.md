# Rhythm

Rhythm lets you selectively broadcast your favorite songs.

## Mockup

![mockup](https://github.com/mnoble/rhythm/raw/master/mockup.png)

## Overview

This app is unfinished. It's my introduction to the iOS SDKs. It's
pretty barebones; it uses the iTunes APIs and some third-party
libraries, but other than that, pretty standard stuff.

## Tests

I know, I know, there aren't any. I'm as bummed about that as you are.
This was an exploratory experiment in learning Obj-C and the iOS SDKs.
Think of it as a prototype or a spike.
